# IOC Extractor

Currently, IOC Extractor is a crude scraper for IOC values in CSV, HTML, and PDF files and outputs `results.csv` file, organized by filename and type of IOC.

Usage: `./ioc-extractor-cli.py <file1> <file2> <file3> <...>`

TODO:
- [ ] cleanup requirements, setup, etc.
- [ ] implement JSON output
- [ ] clean up/add more pattern regexes
